### Introduction
During the early days of remote work in 2020, I developed an internal map application to facilitate location sharing among individuals within our organization. Recently, I found a way to rebuild the same application using Streamlit, and I was able to accomplish it in under 100 lines of code. This streamlit version is easy to deploy within your own organization with minimal effort.
